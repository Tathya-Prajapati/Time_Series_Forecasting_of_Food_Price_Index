# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting of Food Price Index (FPI)

A research project focused on building and comparing statistical and deep learning models to forecast the Food Price Index (FPI)-a key economic indicator used to track global food price trends. This study explores hybrid modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy in the presence of seasonal, nonlinear, and volatile data patterns.

---

## Project Objectives

- Forecast future values of the Food Price Index (FPI) using various time series models.
- Compare classical statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX) with deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU).
- Performed exploratory data analysis and stationarity tests (ADF), ACF/PACF analysis.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Trend, seasonality, ADF test, ACF/PACF plots.
- **Statistical Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX (with exogenous variables).
- **Deep Learning Models:** RNN, LSTM, GRU (built using Keras & TensorFlow).
- **Performance Metrics:** RMSE, AIC for evaluation and comparison.
- **Hybrid Modeling:** Integrating domain knowledge from statistical analysis into neural models for better generalization.
